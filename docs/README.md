# Autonomous Opponent Documentation

This directory contains all documentation for the Autonomous Opponent system, organized by purpose and audience.

## Directory Structure

### üìê `/architecture`
Technical architecture documentation and system design.
- **C4_MODEL.md** - Complete C4 architecture diagrams (Context, Container, Component views)

### üîç `/analysis`
Critical analysis and reality check on the project.
- **COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md** - Complete assessment combining archaeological findings, implementation gaps, rational critique, and brutal honesty about what's needed vs what exists

### üéØ `/vision`
Future state and aspirational documentation.
- **amcp_whitepaper.md** - Advanced Model Context Protocol specification and vision

### üé® `/design`
Design principles and patterns.
- **DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md** - Core design principles including Wisdom Preservation

### üì¶ `/product`
Product requirements and features.
- **prd.md** - Product Requirements Document

## Quick Navigation

### For Developers
1. Start with `/architecture/C4_MODEL.md` to understand system structure
2. **Must read** `/analysis/COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` for reality check
3. Check `/design/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` for coding patterns

### For Project Managers
1. **Must read** `/analysis/COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` for honest status
2. Review `/product/prd.md` for feature requirements
3. Focus on Section 5 (Recommendations) in the analysis

### For Researchers
1. Study `/vision/amcp_whitepaper.md` for theoretical framework
2. Examine `/architecture/C4_MODEL.md` for intended implementation
3. Read the analysis for gap between theory and implementation

## Key Insights

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: There is a significant gap between documentation and implementation. The analysis documents provide honest assessments of current state vs aspirational goals.

‚úÖ **What Works**: Basic Phoenix app, EventBus, AMQP integration (when enabled)

‚ùå **What Doesn't**: VSM implementation, consciousness, most advanced features
