## Status

### Completed
- ✅ All 21 issues created with detailed descriptions
- ✅ All branches created with issue numbers
- ✅ First 4 draft PRs created

### Next Steps
1. Create draft PRs for remaining branches (issues 81-96)
2. Implement changes in priority order (Phase 0 first)
3. Convert draft PRs to ready as implementation completes

## Key Insights from Code Archaeology

1. **CRDT system** - 70% complete, needs activation
2. **HNSW vector index** - 963 lines of unused sophistication
3. **Metrics system** - Works but dashboard ignores it
4. **VSM channels** - Perfect implementation, zero subscribers
5. **Pattern matcher** - Structure exists, temporal patterns are TODOs

This approach transforms the "ChatGPT wrapper" into a functional distributed VSM by connecting existing components rather than building new ones.
