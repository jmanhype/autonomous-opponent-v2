# Development Flow Strategy for VSM Implementation
## Git Branching, CI/CD, and Release Management

This document outlines the development workflow for transforming V1 components into a living VSM system over 22-24 months.

## Branch Strategy - Phase-Aligned Development

### Main Branch Structure

```
main (production-ready releases)
├── develop (integration branch)
├── phase-0-stabilization (Phase 0 work)
├── phase-1-vsm-foundation (Phase 1 work)
├── phase-2-distributed-vsm (Phase 2 work)
└── phase-3-ai-amplification (Phase 3 work)
```

### Detailed Branching Model

#### 1. Core Branches

```
main
├── Always deployable to production
├── Protected: requires PR + reviews + CI passing
├── Tagged releases only (v0.1.0, v1.0.0, etc.)
└── Represents current stable VSM system state

develop
├── Integration branch for completed features
├── Continuous integration testing
├── Nightly deployments to staging
└── Source for phase branch merges

phase-{N}-{name}
├── Long-lived phase branches (3-8 months each)
├── Allows parallel development across phases
├── Independent CI/CD pipelines
└── Merge to develop when phase milestones hit
```

#### 2. Feature Branch Patterns

```
feature/phase-0/fix-missing-dependencies
feature/phase-0/security-hardening-vault
feature/phase-0/mcp-gateway-completion

feature/phase-1/vsm-s1-variety-absorber
feature/phase-1/vsm-s3-resource-optimizer
feature/phase-1/algedonic-pain-signals

feature/phase-2/crdt-beliefset-integration

feature/phase-2/distributed-consciousness

feature/phase-3/ai-amplified-s4-intelligence
feature/phase-3/emergent-behavior-monitoring
feature/phase-3/living-system-validation
```

#### 3. Critical Path Branches

```
hotfix/security-patch-{issue}
├── Direct from main
├── Emergency security fixes
├── Fast-track CI/CD
└── Immediate merge to main + develop

stabilization/v1-component-{name}
├── V1 component fixes and improvements
├── Shared across all phase branches
├── Merge path: stabilization → develop → phase branches
└── Critical for Phase 0 success
```
