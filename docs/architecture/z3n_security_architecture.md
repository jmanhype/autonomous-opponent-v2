# Z3n Security Architecture for Autonomous Opponent

## Overview

The Z3n Security Architecture implements DeadZen's cybernetic security pattern at the network-application boundary, using neural-enhanced Bloom filters for efficient variety management. This architecture solves the "50 network layers" problem by implementing intelligence directly where it matters.

## The Three Zs

### 1. Zone-Aware Routing
- **Consistent hashing** with Bloom filter tracking per zone
- **Neural networks** learn optimal routing patterns from Bloom filter states
- **Variety reduction** through probabilistic zone summaries
- Integration with existing **AMQP topology** (29 queues, 5 exchanges)

### 2. Zombie Node Detection  
- **Bloom filters** track node behavior patterns
- **Neural anomaly detection** observes bit patterns for zombie identification
- **3-out-of-5 consensus** quorum for node health decisions
- **Algedonic pain signals** trigger on zombie detection

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Proof Nonce Detection
- **O(1) membership testing** using existing `NonceValidator` Bloom filter
- **Neural refinement** of false positive rates
- **Distributed across 5 ring-shards** for resilience
- **Temporal rotation** using HLC timestamps

## WSPD Integration

Solves Erlang's n² connection explosion:
- **Well-Separated Pair Decomposition** reduces connections from n² to O(n)
- **Bloom filter state synchronization** instead of full CRDT sync
- **XOR operations** detect state differences efficiently
- **Neural routing decisions** through WSPD topology

## Network-Origin Security Tagging

Frame tagging from BGP to application:
- **Hierarchical Bloom filters**: edge→cluster→node→application
- **64-byte security headers** instead of kilobytes
- **XOR-based tag inheritance** for differential encoding
- **Four-phase processing**: Lexical→Parsing→Modeling→Analysis

## AED Four-Phase Processing

Maps MIT's AED approach to VSM event streams:
1. **Lexical**: EventBus tokenization with Bloom tracking
2. **Parsing**: HLC-ordered event grouping into parse trees
3. **Modeling**: Neural extraction of semantic patterns
4. **Analysis**: S4 Intelligence environmental scanning

## "Maybe Don't" Gateway Pattern

Three-state security decisions:
- **ALLOW**: Not in Bloom filter (proceed)
- **DENY**: Definitely in Bloom filter (block)
- **MAYBE**: Uncertain, needs neural evaluation

## Implementation Path

1. **Task 27**: Core Z3n architecture with neural-Bloom integration
2. **Task 28**: WSPD topology for distributed clusters
3. **Task 29**: Network-origin tagging system
4. **Task 30**: AED four-phase event processing
5. **Task 31**: AMQP security bridge implementation
6. **Task 32**: "Maybe Don't" gateway pattern

## Key Innovations

- **Bloom filters as variety attenuators** - reduce information complexity at each level
- **Neural networks as variety amplifiers** - extract meaning from probabilistic structures
- **Cybernetic feedback loops** - system learns and adapts security patterns
- **Direct container serving** - bypass k8s/load balancer complexity

## Integration Points

- Existing **NonceValidator** already uses Bloom filters
- **SignatureVerifier** provides cryptographic layer
- **LLMBridge** enables neural evaluation
- **VSM subsystems** (S1-S5) provide hierarchical control
- **EventBus** propagates security context
- **AMQP** carries compressed security headers

## Performance Targets

- **<1ms overhead** for security decisions
- **64-byte security headers** (vs kilobytes)
- **O(1) lookups** for most decisions
- **<100ms neural arbitration** for MAYBE states
- **O(n) connections** instead of n² for large clusters

## Cybernetic Principles

Following Beer's VSM and Ashby's Law:
- **Requisite variety** maintained through Bloom compression/neural expansion
- **Variety attenuation** upward (Bloom filters)
- **Variety amplification** downward (neural networks)
- **Homeostatic regulation** through adaptive thresholds
- **Algedonic bypass** for urgent security threats

This architecture creates a true cybernetic security system that adapts, learns, and maintains system viability without adding unnecessary abstraction layers.
