# Task 2: Implement AutonomousOpponent.Core.RateLimiter

## Description
Implement token bucket rate limiter for variety flow control in VSM subsystems

## Implementation Details
Create token bucket algorithm with configurable bucket size and refill rate. Use GenServer for state management and :ets for token storage. Implement per-client and global rate limiting. Add variety flow metrics for VSM S1-S5 subsystems. Include burst handling and graceful degradation when limits exceeded.

## Test Strategy
Unit tests for token bucket mechanics, load tests at various rates, integration tests with MCP gateway, verification of variety flow constraints

## Dependencies
Task dependencies: None
