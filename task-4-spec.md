# Task 4: Implement Intelligence.VectorStore.HNSWIndex

## Description
Implement Hierarchical Navigable Small World index for S4 environmental scanning and pattern recognition

## Implementation Details
Create HNSW implementation using NIFs or pure Elixir with configurable M and ef parameters. Implement vector similarity search with cosine and euclidean distance metrics. Add incremental index building and persistence to disk. Integrate with S4 environmental scanning for pattern detection. Use concurrent processing for index updates.

## Test Strategy
Unit tests for index operations, performance benchmarks for search speed and accuracy, integration tests with S4 subsystem, memory usage validation

## Dependencies
Task dependencies: None
