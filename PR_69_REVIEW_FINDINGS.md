## Issues Found by Reviewers

### 1. **Typo in AMCP Router** (Found by qodo-merge-pro)
- **File**: `apps/autonomous_opponent_core/lib/autonomous_opponent_v2_core/amcp/router.ex`
- **Line**: 81
- **Issue**: Error message says "Invalid AWeb Gateway message" instead of "Invalid Web Gateway message"
- **Impact**: Low - Just a typo in log message
- **Fix**: Change "AWeb Gateway" to "Web Gateway"

### 2. **Typo in Documentation** (Found by qodo-merge-pro)
- **File**: `apps/autonomous_opponent_core/lib/autonomous_opponent_v2_core/amcp/router.ex`
- **Line**: 203
- **Issue**: Documentation comment says "Publishes an AWeb Gateway message" instead of "Web Gateway"
- **Impact**: Low - Documentation inconsistency
- **Fix**: Change "AWeb Gateway" to "Web Gateway"

### 3. **Test Using Wrong Channel Name** (Found by qodo-merge-pro)
- **File**: `apps/autonomous_opponent_web/test/autonomous_opponent_web/channels/web_gateway_channel_test.exs`
- **Line**: 59
- **Issue**: Test is still joining "mcp:gateway" channel instead of "web_gateway:gateway"
- **Impact**: Medium - Will cause test failures
- **Fix**: Change `"mcp:gateway"` to `"web_gateway:gateway"`

### 4. **VSM Architectural Review** (Requested by github-actions)
The VSM advisor bot requested review on:
1. Alignment with Beer's VSM principles
2. Impact on variety absorption (S1) or requisite variety
3. Risk to system viability or emergence
4. Suggestions for enhancing cybernetic feedback loops

## Summary of Required Fixes

### Critical (Must Fix):
1. **Test channel name**: Line 59 in `web_gateway_channel_test.exs` - change to `"web_gateway:gateway"`

### Minor (Should Fix):
1. **Typo in error message**: Line 81 in `amcp/router.ex` - remove "A" from "AWeb Gateway"
2. **Typo in documentation**: Line 203 in `amcp/router.ex` - remove "A" from "AWeb Gateway"

## Notes
- The PR successfully renames 33 files with 196 insertions and 196 deletions
- All module names, directory structures, routes, and configurations have been properly updated
- The renaming is comprehensive and consistent (except for the 3 issues noted above)
- This prepares the codebase for implementing the actual aMCP (Advanced MCP) from the whitepaper

## Recommendation
Fix the three issues identified above before merging. The test channel name fix is critical as it will cause test failures. The typos are minor but should be fixed for consistency.
