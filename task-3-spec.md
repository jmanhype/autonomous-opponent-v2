# Task 3: Implement AutonomousOpponent.Core.Metrics

## Description
Implement comprehensive metrics collection system for VSM subsystem monitoring and cybernetic feedback loops

## Implementation Details
Create metrics aggregation system using :telemetry and Prometheus format. Implement counters, gauges, histograms for VSM subsystems S1-S5. Add custom metrics for variety, algedonic signals, and cybernetic loop performance. Include real-time dashboards and alerting thresholds. Store metrics in ETS with periodic persistence.

## Test Strategy
Unit tests for metric collection, performance tests for high-volume metrics, integration tests with circuit breaker and rate limiter, dashboard functionality verification

## Dependencies
Task dependencies: 1, 2
