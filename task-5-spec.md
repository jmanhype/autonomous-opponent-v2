# Task 5: Implement Intelligence.VectorStore.Quantizer

## Description
Implement vector quantization for efficient S4 pattern recognition and memory optimization

## Implementation Details
Create product quantization with k-means clustering for vector compression. Implement adaptive quantization based on data distribution. Add fine-tuning for search accuracy vs storage trade-offs. Support both scalar and vector quantization methods. Integrate with HNSW index for compressed search.

## Test Strategy
Unit tests for quantization accuracy, performance tests for compression ratios, integration tests with HNSW index, memory usage benchmarks

## Dependencies
Task dependencies: 4
