# Phase 0: VSM Component Stabilization PRD

## Objective
Stabilize V1 components and prepare VSM foundation for Beer's cybernetic implementation.

## Critical Tasks

### Week 1-2: Missing Dependencies (Critical Path)
- Implement AutonomousOpponent.Core.CircuitBreaker for VSM algedonic system
- Implement AutonomousOpponent.Core.RateLimiter for variety flow control  
- Implement AutonomousOpponent.Core.Metrics for VSM subsystem monitoring
- Implement Intelligence.VectorStore.HNSWIndex for S4 environmental scanning
- Implement Intelligence.VectorStore.Quantizer for S4 pattern recognition

### Week 2-3: Security Hardening (Critical)
- Rotate exposed OpenAI API keys in Intelligence layer
- Implement secrets management using Vault or similar
- Enable TLS encryption for all transport layers
- Security audit of V1 components for VSM integration
- Implement audit logging for cybernetic compliance

### Week 3-4: MCP Gateway Completion (High Priority)
- Complete HTTP+SSE transport implementation
- Complete WebSocket transport implementation  
- Fix gateway routing and load balancing
- Add missing error handling paths
- Implement proper connection pooling

### Week 4: Integration Testing Framework (High Priority)
- Create VSM readiness testing framework
- Implement component health monitoring
- Add variety flow testing capabilities
- Performance benchmarking for 100 req/sec sustained load
- Integration tests for V1-V2 component bridge

## Success Criteria
- All missing dependencies implemented and tested
- Zero security vulnerabilities in audit
- All V1 components achieve 80%+ readiness score
- System handles 100 req/sec for 1 hour without failure
- VSM Event Processor routes all events correctly

## Timeline
4 months with weekly go/no-go checkpoints

## Dependencies
- V1 component architecture understanding
- Security compliance requirements
- VSM cybernetic principles (Beer's model)
- Elixir/OTP supervision tree patterns
