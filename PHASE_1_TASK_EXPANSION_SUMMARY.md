## Summary Statistics

- **Total Tasks Expanded**: 7
- **Total Subtasks Created**: 35
- **Average Subtasks per Task**: 5
- **Highest Complexity**: Control Loop Integration & VSM Integration Testing (8)
- **Total AI Tokens Used**: 130,975 (Input: 126,906, Output: 4,069)

## Implementation Priority

Based on dependencies and complexity:

1. **Immediate** (Already Complete):
   - S1 Operations ✅
   - S3 Control ✅
   - S2 Coordination ✅
   - Algedonic System ✅

2. **Next Priority** (Dependencies Met):
   - S4 Intelligence (depends on S1, S2, S3)
   - S5 Policy (depends on S4, Algedonic)

3. **Following Priority**:
   - Control Loop Integration (depends on all S1-S5)
   - VSM Metrics (depends on Control Loop)

4. **Final Priority**:
   - Performance Optimization (depends on Control Loop & Metrics)
   - Integration Testing (depends on Performance Optimization)

## Key Observations

1. **Security Focus**: S5 Policy subtasks heavily focus on security hardening, addressing the exposed API key issue
2. **Testing Infrastructure**: Tasks 9 & 10 provide comprehensive testing framework for VSM validation
3. **Transport Layer**: Control Loop Integration includes both SSE and WebSocket implementations
4. **Performance**: Multiple tasks focus on achieving the 100 req/sec target

## Next Steps

1. Begin S4 Intelligence implementation (5 subtasks)
2. Implement S5 Policy with priority on API key rotation
3. Continue with Control Loop Integration once S4/S5 complete
4. Follow dependency chain through to Integration Testing

The expansion provides clear, actionable subtasks that maintain Beer's VSM principles while addressing practical implementation concerns.
