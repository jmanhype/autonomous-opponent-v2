# Task 6: Stabilize AMQP Infrastructure and Integration

## Description
Fix AMQP connection issues and establish reliable message transport foundation for MCP Gateway and event processing

## Implementation Details
Stabilize AMQP infrastructure with: 1) Fix connection pool issues causing frequent disconnections 2) Implement connection retry logic with exponential backoff 3) Configure proper heartbeat and timeout settings 4) Set up AMQP topology (exchanges, queues, bindings) for VSM communication 5) Implement health monitoring for AMQP connections 6) Create abstraction layer for AMQP operations 7) Add comprehensive error handling and recovery 8) Document AMQP patterns for VSM usage

## Test Strategy
Connection stability tests under load, failover testing with RabbitMQ restarts, message durability tests, performance benchmarks at various message rates, integration tests with EventBus

## Dependencies
