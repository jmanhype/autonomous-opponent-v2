# Test Task Integration

This file is created to test the task tracking workflow.

## Task Context
- Task ID: 1.1
- Phase: 1 (VSM Foundation)
- Purpose: Test Claude OAuth integration with task branches

## Expected Behavior
When this PR is created, the task-tracking workflow should:
1. Extract task ID 1.1 from the branch name
2. Identify Phase 1
3. Create a comment mentioning @claude
4. Request Claude to review the implementation

This tests our OAuth-based Claude integration without using API fees.
