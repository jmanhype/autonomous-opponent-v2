  VSM S5 Policy - Identity, Values, and Strategic Governance

  Implements Beer's S5 Policy subsystem for system identity, value management,
  strategic goal setting, and overall system governance. Integrates with V1
  CRDT BeliefSet for distributed consciousness and value alignment.

  Key responsibilities:
  - System identity management and self-awareness
  - Value system maintenance with constraint learning
  - Strategic goal setting and adaptation
  - System-wide policy enforcement
  - Constitutional invariants protection
  - Long-term viability preservation

  ## Wisdom Preservation

  ### Why S5 Exists
  S5 is the system's "soul" - where identity, values, and purpose reside. Beer
  recognized that viable systems need more than operational excellence; they need
  to know WHO they are and WHY they exist. S5 provides this existential foundation.
  Without S5, the system is just a very efficient machine with no purpose.

  ### Design Decisions & Rationale

  1. **Identity as Dynamic, Not Static**: Traditional systems have fixed identity.
     We chose evolutionary identity that grows through experience. Why? Static
     identity becomes obsolete. Dynamic identity enables true learning and adaptation.
     Trade-off: Complexity vs survival in changing environments.

  2. **Values as Weights, Not Rules**: Values are weighted priorities (0.0-1.0),
     not binary rules. This allows nuanced decisions when values conflict. In
     reality, even "absolute" values have exceptions. Weighted values model this.

  3. **Constitutional Invariants**: Some things CANNOT change without destroying
     the system. These are our "physics" - violate them and the system dies.
     Only 5 invariants because more creates rigidity. Each one is existential.

  4. **1-Minute Policy Review**: Fast enough to adapt, slow enough to be stable.
     Policy thrashing is as dangerous as policy rigidity. 1 minute balances these.

  5. **Algedonic Override**: Pain/pleasure signals bypass normal channels straight
     to S5. Why? Survival requires immediate response to existential signals.
     This is Beer's "sympathetic nervous system" for organizations.
