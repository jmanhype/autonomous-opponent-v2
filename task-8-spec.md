# Task 8: Complete MCP Gateway Transport Implementation

## Description
Complete HTTP+SSE and WebSocket transport layers for MCP gateway with proper routing and connection pooling

## Implementation Details
Implement HTTP+SSE transport using Phoenix.Endpoint and Server-Sent Events. Complete WebSocket transport with Phoenix.Socket. Add gateway routing with load balancing using consistent hashing. Implement connection pooling with configurable pool sizes. Add proper error handling, reconnection logic, and backpressure management.

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Targets
- Support 10,000+ concurrent connections
- Message latency < 100ms at p99
- Zero message loss during transport failover
- Memory usage < 1KB per idle connection
- Automatic reconnection within 5 seconds
- Throughput of 100,000 messages/second aggregate

### Security Requirements
- Rate limiting per client (100 req/sec default)
- Circuit breaker protection per transport
- Connection authentication via client_id
- Optional TLS encryption for WebSocket
- Automatic session invalidation after idle timeout
- Protection against connection flooding attacks

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Two Transport Layers?
- **SSE**: Ideal for server-push scenarios, lower overhead
  - One-way communication reduces complexity
  - Built-in reconnection in modern browsers
  - Works through proxies and firewalls
  - Lower resource usage for read-only clients
- **WebSocket**: Required for bidirectional communication
  - Real-time interactive features
  - Binary protocol support
  - Lower latency for high-frequency updates
  - Compression for bandwidth optimization

### Why Poolboy for Connection Pooling?
- Battle-tested in production environments
- Configurable overflow handling
- Built-in health checks and lifecycle management
- Proven performance under high load
- Easy integration with OTP supervision trees
- Automatic resource cleanup

### Why Consistent Hashing for Load Balancing?
- Minimal key redistribution when nodes change
- Better cache locality for stateful connections
- Predictable routing for debugging
- Support for weighted distribution
- Built-in replication for high availability

### Integration with VSM
- Gateway acts as variety amplifier for external inputs
- All messages flow through S1 (Operations) for processing
- Metrics feed S4 (Intelligence) for environmental awareness
- Circuit breakers controlled by S3 (Control)
- Critical failures trigger algedonic signals

## Test Strategy
Unit tests for transport protocols, load tests with concurrent connections, integration tests with rate limiter and metrics, connection pool behavior verification

## Dependencies
Task dependencies: 2, 3, 6
