# WebSocket Connection Counting - Working Summary

## ✅ What's Working

### 1. **Local Connection Tracking** 
- WebSocket connections are properly tracked in ETS tables
- Connection increments on join
- Connection decrements on disconnect
- Stats are available via `patterns:stats` channel

### 2. **Channel Functionality**
- `patterns:stream` - Working for pattern streaming
- `patterns:stats` - Working for statistics queries
- `patterns:vsm` - Working with error handling for EventBus

### 3. **Stats Queries**
- `get_local_stats` - Returns connection count for current node
- `get_cluster_stats` - Returns stats (currently only local since PatternAggregator not running)

## ⚠️ Minor Issues

### 1. **Off-by-One Count**
The stats connection itself is counted, so if you connect 10 stream connections + 1 stats connection, you'll see 11 total.

### 2. **PatternAggregator Not Starting**
When running as distributed node, the Metrics.Cluster.Supervisor isn't starting. This prevents cluster-wide aggregation but doesn't affect local functionality.

## 📊 Test Results

```
✓ WebSocket connections are tracked correctly
✓ Connection increment/decrement works
✓ Local stats queries work
✓ Channels handle joins/leaves properly
✓ Error handling prevents crashes
```

## 🚀 How to Test

### Quick Test (10 seconds)
```bash
./test_ws_fast.sh
```

### Comprehensive Test  
```bash
./run_full_test.sh
```

### Manual Test
```bash
# Start server
elixir --name test@127.0.0.1 -S mix phx.server

# In another terminal
node test_websocket_quick.js
```

## 💯 Conclusion

WebSocket connection counting is working at the local node level. The feature tracks connections, provides stats, and handles disconnections properly. The only missing piece is cluster-wide aggregation via PatternAggregator, which requires the Metrics.Cluster.Supervisor to be running.
