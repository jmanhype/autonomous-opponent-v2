Execute VSM-focused multi-specialist analysis on: $ARGUMENTS

## VSM Multi-Mind Collaborative Intelligence

Launch parallel specialist subagents for VSM-specific analysis using the Task tool:

### Dynamic Specialist Assignment

Based on the topic "$ARGUMENTS", automatically select 4-6 specialists from:

**Core VSM Specialists:**
- **Cybernetics Specialist**: Beer's principles, variety engineering, control theory
- **Systems Integration Specialist**: V1/V2 component integration, architectural patterns
- **Elixir/Phoenix Specialist**: Technical implementation, OTP patterns, performance
- **Distributed Systems Specialist**: CRDT, consensus, emergence, scaling

**Domain-Specific Specialists (as needed):**
- **AI/ML Specialist**: Intelligence amplification, learning systems, neural networks
- **Security Specialist**: Cybersecurity, audit trails, compliance, threat modeling
- **Performance Specialist**: Optimization, scalability, resource management
- **UX/Interface Specialist**: Human-system interaction, monitoring interfaces
- **DevOps Specialist**: Deployment, CI/CD, infrastructure, observability

### Implementation Protocol

#### Phase 1: Independent Research (Parallel Tasks)
Launch Task tool subagents with prompts like:

```
Task 1: "Cybernetics Specialist Analysis"
As a cybernetics specialist trained in Stafford Beer's VSM, analyze [topic] focusing on:
- Compliance with Beer's 5 subsystem principles
- Variety engineering requirements
- Control loop effectiveness
- Recursive structure implications
Use WebSearch to find latest VSM research and implementations.

Task 2: "V1 Component Integration Specialist"
As a systems integration specialist, analyze [topic] focusing on:
- How V1 components map to VSM requirements
- Integration complexity and dependencies
- Component readiness assessment
- Missing pieces identification
Review V1 component audit findings and integration patterns.
```

#### Phase 2: Cross-Pollination Analysis
After collecting initial reports, launch second round:
- Each specialist reviews others' findings
- Challenges assumptions from their perspective
- Identifies intersection points and conflicts
- Builds on insights while maintaining distinct viewpoint

#### Phase 3: VSM Viability Synthesis
Final round focuses on:
- Overall system viability assessment
- Implementation feasibility analysis
- Risk identification and mitigation
- Concrete next steps recommendation

### Anti-Repetition Mechanisms

**VSM-Specific Guidelines:**
- Build on Beer's established principles rather than restating them
- Focus on practical implementation challenges
- Identify novel applications of cybernetic theory
- Challenge group consensus from specialist perspective
- Search for VSM implementations in other domains
