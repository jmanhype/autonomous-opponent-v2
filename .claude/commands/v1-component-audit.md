Perform comprehensive V1 component audit for: $ARGUMENTS

## V1 Component Audit Framework

Analyze the specified V1 component "$ARGUMENTS" for VSM integration readiness:

### 1. **Component Discovery & Mapping**
- Locate all files related to the component
- Map component structure and dependencies
- Identify main modules, interfaces, and APIs
- Document component boundaries and responsibilities

### 2. **Implementation Completeness Assessment**
```
Audit Checklist:
□ Core functionality implemented vs. documented claims
□ All referenced dependencies exist and are functional
□ Error handling and edge cases covered
□ Configuration and initialization complete
□ Testing coverage and quality
□ Documentation accuracy and completeness
```

### 3. **VSM Integration Readiness**
- **S1 Operations**: Can this component serve as variety absorber?
- **S2 Coordination**: Does it support anti-oscillation mechanisms?
- **S3 Control**: Can it participate in resource allocation decisions?
- **S4 Intelligence**: Does it provide environmental scanning capabilities?
- **S5 Policy**: Can it support identity and purpose functions?

### 4. **Technical Health Assessment**
- **Code Quality**: Structure, patterns, maintainability
- **Performance**: Scalability, resource usage, bottlenecks
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities, exposure points, audit compliance
- **Dependencies**: External libs, internal coupling, version compatibility
- **Configuration**: Environment management, secrets handling

### 5. **Integration Complexity Analysis**
- **API Compatibility**: Interfaces that need adaptation for VSM
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through the component
- **State Management**: Internal state and external coordination
- **Event Integration**: Pub/sub patterns and event handling
- **Resource Requirements**: CPU, memory, I/O, network needs

### 6. **Gap Analysis**
```
Missing Elements:
□ Required interfaces not implemented
□ Dependencies that don't exist
□ Configuration gaps
□ Security vulnerabilities
□ Performance bottlenecks
□ Testing inadequacies
```

### 7. **VSM Enhancement Recommendations**
- **Variety Engineering**: How to add variety amplification/attenuation
- **Control Integration**: Connecting to VSM control loops
- **Algedonic Channels**: Adding pain/pleasure signal capability
- **Recursive Structure**: Making component VSM-aware
- **Monitoring**: VSM-specific metrics and observability

### 8. **Implementation Priority Assessment**
- **Critical Path**: Is this component blocking VSM implementation?
- **Risk Level**: High/Medium/Low risk for integration
- **Effort Estimate**: Implementation complexity and time requirements
- **Dependencies**: What else needs to be done first

### 9. **Specific Action Items**
Generate concrete tasks:
- Code changes required
- New modules to implement
- Tests to write
- Documentation to update
- Configuration to add

### 10. **Component Readiness Score**
