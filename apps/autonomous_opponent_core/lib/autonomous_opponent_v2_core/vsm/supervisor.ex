  The Viable System Model (VSM) Supervisor.

  This supervisor is responsible for dynamically starting and managing VSM components
  based on configurations fetched from the database. It embodies the self-organizing
  and adaptive nature of the Cybernetic system.

  **Wisdom Preservation:** This dynamic approach allows the system to adapt its
  structure at runtime, a key principle for resilience and continuous evolution.
  The configuration in the database serves as a living blueprint for the system's
  current and desired state.
