			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the circuit breaker implementation into: GenServer foundation with state management, core state machine logic for transitions, configurable thresholds and timeouts, EventBus integration for alerts, and ETS-based metrics collection.",
			"reasoning": "Already well-decomposed with 5 subtasks. Complex state machine logic and integration requirements justify moderate complexity score."

			"taskTitle": "Implement AutonomousOpponent.Core.RateLimiter",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: token bucket algorithm implementation, GenServer state management and ETS storage, per-client and global rate limiting logic, and variety flow metrics integration with VSM subsystems.",
			"reasoning": "Token bucket algorithm is well-established but requires careful concurrency handling and integration with VSM concepts."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement AutonomousOpponent.Core.Metrics",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: telemetry integration setup, Prometheus format implementation, VSM-specific metrics for S1-S5 subsystems, ETS storage with persistence, real-time dashboard creation, and alerting threshold configuration.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple integrations (telemetry, Prometheus, VSM), dashboard requirements, and dependencies on other components."

			"taskTitle": "Implement Intelligence.VectorStore.HNSWIndex",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: HNSW algorithm core implementation, distance metrics (cosine/euclidean), configurable parameters (M, ef), incremental index building, disk persistence, concurrent processing optimization, and S4 integration for pattern detection.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity - implementing HNSW from scratch is algorithmically challenging, requires performance optimization, and has complex integration requirements."

			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Intelligence.VectorStore.Quantizer",
			"complexityScore": 8,

			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: product quantization with k-means clustering, adaptive quantization based on data distribution, accuracy vs storage trade-off configuration, scalar and vector quantization methods, and HNSW index integration.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to advanced mathematical algorithms, optimization requirements, and tight integration with HNSW index."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: API key rotation implementation, secrets management system integration (Vault or built-in), TLS 1.3 configuration and certificate management, encrypted configuration setup, and automated security audit implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Security tasks require careful implementation and comprehensive testing. Multiple integration points increase complexity."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: structured audit logging with custom formatters, VSM subsystem audit trail implementation, log aggregation with retention policies, and tamper-evident logging with cryptographic signatures.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with established patterns but requires integration with VSM concepts and cryptographic security measures."
