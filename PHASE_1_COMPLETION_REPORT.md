- Pattern extraction from operational data

### 6. S5 Policy - Identity and Governance (PENDING)
- System identity management
- Value system with constraints
- Strategic goal setting

### 10. Integration Testing (PENDING)
- End-to-end VSM validation

- V1 component integration

## Critical Security Issue

**⚠️ URGENT**: OpenAI API key still exposed in `/config/llm_config.json`
- Immediate rotation required
- Implement environment variable storage
- Add to .gitignore

## Technical Debt Identified

1. **Stub Implementations**: Several helper functions need real implementations
2. **V1 Integration Points**: Hooks exist but need actual V1 component connections
3. **Workflow Integration**: S2/S3 reference V1 Workflows but not connected
4. **Performance Tuning**: Kalman filters and bargaining algorithms need optimization

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. **Immediate** (Today):
   - Rotate exposed API key
   - Run full test suite
   - Deploy to development environment

2. **Short-term** (This Week):
   - Implement S4 Intelligence
   - Implement S5 Policy
   - Begin control loop integration

3. **Medium-term** (Next Week):
   - Complete remaining Phase 1 tasks
   - Performance optimization
   - Full integration testing

## Conclusion

Phase 1 has achieved remarkable progress with 40% completion in a single session. The core VSM control mechanisms are in place, following Beer's cybernetic principles faithfully. The system now has:

- Operational variety absorption (S1)
- Anti-oscillation coordination (S2)
- Resource optimization with predictive control (S3)
- Emergency intervention capability (Algedonic)

The foundation is solid for completing the remaining S4/S5 subsystems and achieving full VSM self-regulation capability.
