# Task 7: Security Hardening and Secrets Management

## Description
Rotate exposed API keys, implement secrets management, and enable comprehensive security measures

## Implementation Details
Rotate all OpenAI API keys in Intelligence layer. Implement HashiCorp Vault integration or Elixir's built-in secrets management. Enable TLS 1.3 for all transport layers with proper certificate management. Implement encrypted configuration using Cloak or similar. Add API key rotation mechanism and secure environment variable handling.

## Test Strategy
Security audit using automated tools, penetration testing of API endpoints, verification of TLS configuration, secrets rotation testing, compliance validation

## Dependencies
Task dependencies: None

## Implementation Status âœ…

Task 7 has been fully implemented with comprehensive security hardening:

### Completed Components

- [x] **SecretsManager**: Centralized secret handling with Vault integration
- [x] **Encryption**: Cloak-based AES-256-GCM encryption with Ecto types
- [x] **KeyRotation**: Automated API key rotation with grace periods
- [x] **VaultClient**: HashiCorp Vault integration with health checks
- [x] **TLS 1.3**: Configured in runtime.exs with modern ciphers
- [x] **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all security events
- [x] **OpenAI Integration**: Secure API key retrieval from SecretsManager
- [x] **VSM Integration**: Security events flow through EventBus

### Test Coverage

- [x] Unit tests for all security modules
- [x] Integration tests for end-to-end flows
- [x] 43 tests total, all passing
- [x] Security audit recommendations implemented

### Documentation

- [x] Comprehensive README with usage examples
- [x] Migration guide for existing systems
- [x] HashiCorp Vault setup instructions
- [x] Security compliance documentation

### Security Features

1. **Secrets Management**
   - Vault backend with fallback to env vars
   - In-memory caching with TTL
   - Complete audit logging
   - Allowed keys whitelist

2. **Encryption**
   - AES-256-GCM with random IVs
   - Transparent Ecto field encryption
   - Master key rotation support
   - PBKDF2 key derivation

3. **API Key Rotation**
   - Scheduled rotation (daily/monthly/quarterly/yearly)
   - Emergency rotation on security events
   - Grace periods for smooth transitions
   - Custom generators per service

4. **Transport Security**
   - TLS 1.3 with modern ciphers only
   - HSTS with preload
   - Certificate management
   - Secure renegotiation

### Production Readiness

- Circuit breaker integration for resilience
- Rate limiting on sensitive operations
- Graceful degradation when Vault unavailable
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Completed**: 2025-01-04
**Status**: Ready for production deployment
