## PR #115: WebSocket Connection Counting Implementation

Hey @claude! üëã 

We've successfully implemented WebSocket connection counting functionality with 100% working features. I'd love for you to review our implementation and provide feedback.

## What We Implemented

### 1. **Connection Tracking System**
- Real-time WebSocket connection tracking using ETS tables
- Per-topic connection counting (stream, stats, vsm channels)
- Automatic increment on join, decrement on disconnect
- Node-specific and cluster-wide statistics

### 2. **Stats API via WebSocket**
```elixir
# New handlers in patterns_channel.ex
def handle_in("get_local_stats", _payload, socket)
def handle_in("get_cluster_stats", _payload, socket)
```

### 3. **Key Fixes Applied**
- Fixed PatternAggregator initialization (pg group error handling)
- Added EventBus subscription error handling
- Fixed off-by-one counting issue (separate stream_count)
- Added health_check/0 to WebGateway for S4 compatibility
- Updated S4 Intelligence supervisor health checks

## Code Changes

### Modified Files:
1. `apps/autonomous_opponent_web/lib/autonomous_opponent_web_web/channels/patterns_channel.ex`
   - Added connection tracking with ETS
   - Implemented stats handlers
   - Added stream_count for accurate counting

2. `apps/autonomous_opponent_core/lib/autonomous_opponent_v2_core/metrics/cluster/pattern_aggregator.ex`
   - Fixed pg group initialization
   - Added error handling for EventBus

3. `apps/autonomous_opponent_core/lib/autonomous_opponent_v2_core/web_gateway/gateway.ex`
   - Added health_check/0 function

4. `apps/autonomous_opponent_core/lib/autonomous_opponent_v2_core/vsm/s4/intelligence.ex`
   - Updated to handle supervisor health checks properly

## Test Results

All tests passing! ‚úÖ
- Connection tracking: Working
- Stats queries: Working
- Error handling: Working
- Multiple channels: Working
- Cluster support: Ready

## Questions for Review

1. **ETS Table Design**: We used a simple key-value structure `{{topic, node}, count}`. Is this sufficient or should we consider a more complex data structure?

2. **Error Handling**: We added try/catch blocks for EventBus and pg group operations. Are there other failure modes we should consider?

3. **Performance**: The current implementation updates ETS on every join/leave. Should we consider batching or rate limiting for high-traffic scenarios?

4. **Cluster Aggregation**: The PatternAggregator is ready but requires distributed Erlang. Should we add more robust single-node fallbacks?

## How to Test

```bash
# Start server
elixir --name test@127.0.0.1 -S mix phx.server

# Run demo
node test_websocket_demo.js
```

## Documentation

We've added comprehensive documentation:
- `WEBSOCKET_100_PERCENT_WORKING.md` - Complete feature documentation
- `WEBSOCKET_WORKING_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary
- Test files demonstrating usage

## Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for:
- Real-time connection monitoring dashboards
- Load balancing decisions
- Rate limiting per connection type
- Connection analytics

Would love your thoughts on the implementation and any suggestions for improvements!

Thanks for reviewing! üôè
